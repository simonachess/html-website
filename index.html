        <h2>What is chess?</h2>
        <p>Chess is a board game played between two players that simulates a war between two kingdoms. It is one of the
            most popular games in the world. Millions of people play it both recreationally and competitively. It is
            played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls
            sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The player who
            moves first controls white pieces, and the other controls black pieces. The object of the game is to
            checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is
            no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
